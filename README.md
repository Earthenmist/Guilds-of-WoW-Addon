# Guilds of WoW Addon

Welcome to [Guilds of WoW](https://gow.gg) in-game addon.

## FEATURES

-   In-game event generation and inviting characters within rules.

-   Team bound events and only inviting characters within that team.

-   Exposes up to 3 upcoming events through an addon-to-addon data channel, enabling integration with WeakAuras or custom event-driven addons.

-   Exporting attendance data to Guilds of WoW for attendance reports and syncing RSVPs bidirectional.

-   Easier in-game recruitment management for inviting to guild, adding as friend or whispering.

-   Syncing back your guild's Mythic+ keystones to GoW and Discord (Requires 'Astral Keys' and/or 'Details' addons).

## WA Trigger Setup

-   **Event Type**: `Addon Message` (TSU)
-   **Prefix**: `GuildsOfWoW`

### Trigger Function Example

    function(event, prefix, message, channel, sender)
        if prefix ~= "GuildsOfWoW" then return false end

        local events = aura_env.events or {}
        local parsed = {}

        for pair in string.gmatch(message, "([^&]+)") do
            local k, v = string.match(pair, "([^=]+)=([^=]+)")
            if k and v then parsed[k] = v end
        end

        if parsed.title and parsed.eventDate then
            table.insert(events, parsed)
            aura_env.events = events
            return true
        end

        return false
    end

## Notes

-   Messages are **not compressed** or encoded â€” they're human-readable.
-   Each WA client independently collects events as they arrive.
-   If no addon user is online, **data may become stale** until another update is sent.
-   You can extend your WA with custom options like "Show locked events" or "Max # of events to display".
