# Guilds-of-WoW-Addon
Welcome to Guilds of WoW in-game addon.

This addon is now on beta and subject to change.


This project is in-game addon of Guilds of WoW. It is aiming to help guilds who use Guilds of WoW with in-game functionalities.
 

At the moment addon migrates Guilds of WoW upcoming events to in-game calendar. After exporting your data from Guilds of WoW to your _retail_ folder with instructions, an in game window will show related events to you. You can create the events you like on your calendar with all your migrated data. This system allows periodic creation of your weekly events by given roster data.


If event has minimum item level then only related characters will be invited.
 

## HOW TO USE

In order to use this addon your guild must have been created on Guilds of WoW.

If you are not the guild master then ask from your GM to give you related permissions for event management.

When you access events section of your guild management, at least one weekly event with "create upcoming events automatically" flag should be saved. After your upcoming events are generated you should navigate to Addon page and then set your permissions for WoW retail folder. This will generate your event data to in game addon database.
